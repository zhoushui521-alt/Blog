# Jojo on joyehuang.me

Jojo is Joye's character (the approved lead of the private _Jojo & Friends_
family). This site shows it in three ways that are designed to work together.

## Three surfaces

### A · signature

- **What:** Jojo seated beside the home avatar (pokeable), a card at the end of
  every post, the 404 page, and an About section with the short film and three
  friends.
- **Where:** `src/components/jojo/JojoHero.tsx`, `JojoArticleEnd.astro`,
  `JojoNotFound.astro`, `JojoAbout.astro`, `JojoMark.astro`.
- **JS:** the seat is a React island (`client:idle`); the rest is build-time SVG
  plus a few lines.

### B · dock

- **What:** a resident companion in the bottom-right corner with real
  shortcuts, poke/tuck, and a chat area that honestly says chat is not
  connected.
- **Where:** `JojoDock.tsx`, `dock.css`, `src/lib/jojo/chat/*`, `presence.ts`.
- **JS:** a React island (`client:idle`) on every page.

### C · intro

- **What:** "Jojo builds the site", a first-visit intro compressed from the
  29 s film (≈ 4.4 s at 1440×900, 3.9 s at 1280×720 or 390×844, 3.2 s
  at 375×667). As Jojo pops out under the avatar, the
  first screen dims in place to a faint blueprint (nothing flies away). Then
  Jojo builds it back along one route down the page: a short tether pulls the
  header down; the thump knocks the avatar loose onto Jojo's head, and Jojo
  tosses it onto its spot; a stomp pops Connect, the label chips and the name
  up; a shove lays the terminal card out to the right; Jojo slides down
  About's left edge and reveals it like a blind; a last stomp makes the
  Product card rise from below the fold to its feet. Then Jojo leaps home into
  its seat. Pieces only move rigidly or are revealed by a clip, never
  flattened or stretched.
- **Keep-out (phones, r3):** where Jojo stands is chosen against what is
  already built. The labels stomp happens in the free space beside them (on
  phones: below the chips, left of Connect — never on "Melbourne"); with no
  margin beside About (phones) Jojo hangs under the blind's edge, so the text
  it reveals is above it, and the rest drops as it leaps off. Skip sits in the
  bottom-right corner on phones (44 px tall; the dock is hidden during the
  intro), its measured rect is a keep-out for the whole route, and the tests
  sample every frame for it. Only flights (hops, the leap home) may pass over
  finished text, ≤ 150 ms per label.
- **Who takes part:** only pieces at least 35 % on screen. Desktop 1440×900
  gets all nine; 1280×720 and 390×844 skip Product (below the fold); 375×667
  also skips About; `/en` has no Product. Nothing off screen is dragged in.
- **Measuring:** stand-ins are measured only after the page's own `.animate`
  entrance has finished (the entry waits for it, `runIntro` finishes any
  leftover), and ids / custom-element tags are replaced by their computed
  style on the copies, so the copies match the page exactly (the r2 build lost
  `#toggleDarkMode` styles and stacked the theme icons).
- **Where:** `JojoHead.astro` (gate), `JojoIntro.astro` → `intro/entry.ts`
  (every entry), `src/lib/jojo/intro/*`.
- **JS:** loaded only when it plays.

## How they combine

By default: first visit to `/` or `/en` → C plays and ends
by landing in A's seat → while the seat is on screen the dock stays away; once
the hero scrolls off, B slides in. On posts, the dock keeps you company and
steps aside when the end-of-post Jojo (A) or, on phones, the comment box comes
into view. One Jojo per viewport, always. Return visits: no intro, everything
still unless poked.

## Reduced motion and Save-Data ("still")

- **No intro from any entry:** first visit, `?jojo-intro=play`, the dock's
  replay and the review pill all go through `intro/entry.ts`, which refuses
  _before_ the intro chunk is fetched. `runIntro` and the controller check
  again at the real start.
- **A refusal touches nothing:** no stage, no hidden originals, not marked as
  seen. `data-jojo-intro` ends on `done` (never stuck on `armed`) and a
  `jojo:intro` event with `phase: 'refused'` is sent.
- **Switched on mid-run:** the run ends and the page is restored — at once on
  a change event, otherwise on the next frame (Chrome fires no event when
  Save-Data changes).
- **Hero and dock:** no greeting, no pointer-follow, no hover/focus prefetch,
  and no replay entry in the dock. A tap may still load the engine and swap to
  a static face (`motion: 'static'`); nothing animates continuously.
- **Late work never lands:** face runs go through `lib/jojo/steps.ts`. A
  reaction whose engine download finishes after unmount, after a newer
  reaction, or not at all creates no timer and changes nothing. A failed
  download leaves the static frame; the loader forgets it so a later tap asks
  again, but Chrome keeps a failed module fetch failed for the page's lifetime,
  so in practice Jojo stays static until the next page load.

## The private package boundary

The character engine and artwork are **not** in this repository (Apache-2.0).
They come from the private `@joyehuang/jojo-web` package, built from a private
branch of `joyehuang/jojo-friends` (see that repo's `docs/WEB-PACKAGE.md`).
This repo contains only integration code, a loader and a sha256 pin.

`scripts/jojo/jojo-web.mjs` runs from `astro.config.ts` and puts the package in
gitignored `vendor/jojo-web/`, first match wins:

- **`JOJO_WEB_DIR=/path/to/dist-web`:** local work against a private
  checkout.
- **`JOJO_WEB_TGZ=/path/to/pkg.tgz`:** a packed tarball; it must match the pin.
- **`vendor/jojo-web` at the pinned version:** already installed.
- **`JOJO_WEB_TOKEN=<read-only token>`:** CI/Vercel. Downloads the release
  asset named in `scripts/jojo/jojo-web.lock.json` through the GitHub API
  (token in a header — never in a URL, lockfile or log), verifies sha256,
  unpacks.
- **None of the above → Jojo off:** the site builds exactly as before
  (particle intro, ASCII mascot, promo modal).

`PUBLIC_JOJO=0` also switches Jojo off with the package present — that is the
rollback switch. `@jojo-web/runtime` / `@jojo-web/static` resolve (Vite alias)
to the vendor files or to typed stand-ins in `src/lib/jojo/fallback/`, so
`astro check` passes with or without the package.

### Credentials and trust

- The token is a GitHub fine-grained token limited to `joyehuang/jojo-friends`,
  **Contents: Read-only**. Keep it in `~/.config/…` (0600) locally or as the
  Vercel env var `JOJO_WEB_TOKEN`.
- Scope that env var to **Production** and to explicitly trusted Preview
  branches only. A Preview build executes the branch's code, so any branch that
  can see the token can exfiltrate the package. Fork PRs and unreviewed branches
  must build without it (they then get the Jojo-off site, which is fine).
- Status on 2026-09-25: no such token exists yet (creating one needs the owner
  in the GitHub UI). Until then Git-triggered Vercel builds are Jojo-off, and a
  Jojo Preview is produced manually from a trusted worktree that has
  `vendor/jojo-web`: `vercel deploy --build-env PUBLIC_JOJO_REVIEW=1` (Preview,
  never `--prod`). The CLI uploads the vendor files and Vercel builds on
  Linux; no token is involved. Local `vercel build` + `--prebuilt` does not
  work here (the adapter maps local Node 24 to an unsupported runtime and
  would bundle macOS-native binaries).

### What visitors can extract

Browsers receive the runtime JS (≈ 18 KB gzip) and rendered SVG; a determined
visitor can save them. That is the unavoidable cost of showing a character on
the web and does not grant any rights. No obfuscation or right-click blocking
is used. The runtime chunk contains Jojo only — no other family member's data;
About ships three friends as finished static SVG.

## Review builds

`PUBLIC_JOJO_REVIEW=1` (manual Preview only) adds a "Jojo · Review" pill:
switch scheme (`?jojo=abc|a|b|c|off`, kept for the session), replay or re-arm
the intro without clearing storage by hand, and preview chat _states_ on the
dock, labelled as a demo. `?jojo-intro=play` replays the intro in any build
(reduced motion and Save-Data still win; the pill says so). In review builds `window.__jojoIntro.seek(ms)`
freezes the intro at a frame for inspection.

## Decisions to review

- **Promo:** in Jojo mode the first-visit promo modal is not rendered (it would
  stack a second mask right after the intro); the in-page promo card stays and
  the bottom-left popout waits for the intro to finish. Production promo
  behaviour is unchanged while Jojo is off.
- **Film hosting:** About links the published film on Cloudflare's `r2.dev`
  host (rate-limited dev hostname). Move it to a production host before launch.
- **Copy:** the few Jojo lines (About, 404, end card, dock) are placeholders in
  the site's voice; final wording is Joye's call.
- **Coral dot at 24–32 px** may read as a notification badge.

## Tests

- `bun test src/lib/jojo` — gate, timeline (fits 2.5–4.5 s, starts and ends
  exactly on the real page, nothing flattened/stretched, dims to a blueprint in
  place, every piece arrives by a Jojo action, short tether only), controller (complete, skip by
  key/pointer/wheel/touch/scroll, hidden tab, pagehide, watchdog, render error,
  mount failure, seek, refuse while still, still switched on mid-run), entry
  (every trigger refuses before the chunk loads, never left `armed`), step
  player (unmount / superseded / failed download), still helpers, poke,
  presence, chat adapter, analytics once-per-view.
- Private repo: `tests/web-package.test.tsx` — the built package draws the
  approved Jojo byte-for-byte (16 emotions × 6 statuses × 3 sizes) and never
  shares SVG ids across instances.
- `node scripts/jojo/measure-pages.mjs dist/client / /en /404 …` — per-page
  HTML/JS inventory (initial vs on-demand chunks), duplicate ids.
