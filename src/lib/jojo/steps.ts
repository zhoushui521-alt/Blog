/**
 * Plays a short run of faces on a Jojo whose engine may still be downloading.
 * The download is async and the component can unmount, or the visitor can do
 * something newer, before it lands; so every play() is a request, and only the
 * latest request of a live player may touch state or create timers:
 *
 *  - a newer play() / set() / cancel() supersedes an older one still loading;
 *  - dispose() (unmount) drops every pending request and timer for good;
 *  - a failed download plays nothing (the static frame stays — no pretend
 *    reaction on a Jojo that cannot show it).
 *
 * The final step always settles back to `calm`.
